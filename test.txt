    Center a column in a window

    Solves a very specific kind of layout.
    If you want to have something centered in a Window, this is a good way to do it
    The "trick" here is:
        * the first row of the layout has a Text element that expands vertically
        * the row with the Column has a text element that expands horizontally

    This expanding Text element is what will cause the Column element to be centered
